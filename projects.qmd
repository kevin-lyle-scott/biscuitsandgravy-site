## Research

### SketchRAG
Dimension reduction for retrieval systems using sketching algorithms. Reduces embedding dimensions by 90% while maintaining retrieval accuracy.

### MetaChunk
Intelligent document segmentation using metadata-aware boundaries. Improves context preservation in retrieval-augmented generation.

### GraphAgent
Graph-based retrieval architecture for multi-hop reasoning. Combines knowledge graphs with autonomous agent systems.

## Open Source

Contributing to the machine learning community through optimizations and benchmarking tools.

- LangChain optimizations for RAG pipeline efficiency
- Vector database performance benchmarks
- Fine-tuning utilities for memory-efficient training

## Collaboration

Working with Ethan Davis at SAS Institute on embedding compression techniques. Focus on practical applications of dimension reduction in production systems.
