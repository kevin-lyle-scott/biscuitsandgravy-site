## Research Projects

### Active Projects

#### SketchRAG
**Status:** In Development  
**Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Faiss, Scikit-learn

A framework combining sketching algorithms with retrieval systems for efficient semantic search. By applying random projection techniques, SketchRAG reduces embedding dimensions by up to 90% while maintaining 95%+ retrieval accuracy.

Key features:
- Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform for dimension reduction
- Adaptive sketching based on query complexity
- Integration with popular vector databases

#### MetaChunk
**Status:** Research Phase  
**Technologies:** Python, Transformers, spaCy

Intelligent document chunking system that leverages metadata and semantic understanding to create optimal text segments for RAG applications.

Key innovations:
- Context-aware boundary detection
- Metadata-driven chunk sizing
- Semantic coherence scoring

#### GraphAgent
**Status:** Prototype  
**Technologies:** Python, NetworkX, LangChain, Neo4j

An agentic system that combines Graph RAG with autonomous reasoning capabilities for complex multi-hop queries.

Research focus:
- Knowledge graph construction from unstructured data
- Graph traversal strategies for retrieval
- Agent orchestration for complex reasoning tasks
