    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page, "scrollytelling" experience that guides the user through a logical narrative: Problem -> Existing Solutions -> The LSC Solution -> Evaluation -> Future. This structure is more intuitive for learning than mirroring the original report's academic sections. It starts broad and progressively deepens the user's understanding. Key interactions include a visual demonstration of chunking flaws, a comparative chart for different paradigms, and an interactive, multi-layered flowchart of the LSC algorithm. This task-oriented flow, focused on understanding and comparison, was chosen to make the highly technical content digestible for a professional audience (NLP researchers, engineers) by breaking it into thematically coherent, interactive sections. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application uses a variety of interactive elements to explain complex concepts without SVG or Mermaid. 1) Chunking Flaws (Compare): Text blocks are dynamically highlighted/split to visually demonstrate context fragmentation and semantic dilution. 2) Paradigm Comparison (Compare/Organize): A tabbed interface presents data from Table 1, coupled with a dynamic Chart.js Radar chart to visually compare paradigms on key axes (Granularity, Context, Cost). This is more engaging than a static table. 3) LSC Algorithm (Organize/Inform): A multi-layered flowchart built with HTML/Tailwind visually represents the 4-stage pipeline from Section 4. Clicking each stage reveals detailed information, turning a complex process into an explorable diagram. 4) Evaluation Metrics (Inform): An interactive card grid presents the proposed metrics from Table 3, allowing users to focus on one concept at a time. All choices prioritize interaction and clarity over static presentation, using Chart.js and custom JS/HTML/CSS as the implementation method. -->
